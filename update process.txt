We have updated the wallet as we had to increase pre mine from 5% to 10%. This is done so that we can list on HitBTC or such huge exchanges. The exchanges want to have security funds and so the pre mine is needed. Also we will open the ICO again for just a few days so that more people can buy. Our Japanese local promoters were complaining that they did not got any coins to provide to their customers. In order to have more community, more people and more volume, this decision is taken. Also citing the huge demand for our coin. This is good for everyone.
